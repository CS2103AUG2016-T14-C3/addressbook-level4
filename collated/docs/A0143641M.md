### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskmanager/storage/Storage.java)

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Taskmanager data in .xml format and read it back.
* can save the Taskmanager data at a specified location and access the data accordingly.
